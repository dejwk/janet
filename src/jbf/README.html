This directory contains a few non-essential files from the
<a href=http://www.cs.colorado.edu/serl/misc/jb.html>JB</a>
system
that the JANET tool uses at the run time. JB is a
<a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~serl/gettoolpage.tcl?TOOL=jb7.0">
public domain</a>
parser and lexer generator for Java.
JB has been developed by <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/users/dennis/">Dennis Heimbigner</a>
at the University of Colorado.

JANET has been developed with aid of the JB. To build JANET from
source files, you need full JB package. It can be downloaded from
sites given above. Files in this directory are those used by
the JANET tool at the run time only.
