This directory contains some JANET examples.

UNIX users:

You may build the examples using the included makefile. However,
you will need to modify it to meet your operating system requirements.
At least, you must provide platform name (so that the JNI include
files may be found) and compiler options (so that a shared library
is generated). Appropriate definitions for Linux and Solaris are 
already provided - you only need to uncomment appropriate lines.

You may start the examples using "run" macro.


Win32 users:

Unfortunately, there are no build macros provided for Win32. In order
to build the library please do the following:
1. run JANET on the *.janet files,
2. use javac to compile all *.java source files. 
3. Build "examples.dll" out of C files generated by JANET in step 1.
   You may want to use some IDE, e.g. MS Visual C++.
   DON'T FORGET TO INCLUDE "%JANET_DIR%\native\c\include\janet.c" FILE
   IN THE LIBRARY.

%JANET_DIR% is the directory where you installed JANET.

After you built the library you need to make it accessible through the 
%PATH% environment variable.

To start examples, go to the %JANET_DIR% and write:

java examples.Main
